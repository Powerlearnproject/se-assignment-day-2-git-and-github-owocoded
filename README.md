## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Ans:
Version control help us and give us the ability to monitor and maintain our codebase in any project, it helps to know the update that is being done to our project by the member of the team.
2. Github is popular because it is easy to navigate and easy to work on from your IDE terminal.
3. Version control helps us to know the update and changes in our codebase project.


## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

Ans:
You can set up a repository from your IDE terminal or set up a repository from GitHub website.
To create a repository from GitHub website, you first need to have a GitHub account then navigate to create a new repository, click on it and give your repository a name, you can set up a readme file if you want, also you can set your repository to public or private.
2. You must give your repository a name name if you are creating it from GitHub website of your IDE terminal, also you must set up a readme file for your repository.
3. You must decide if to make your repository private or public.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

Ans:
1. Readme file help to give full description of our project and make is easy for others to make contribution to our project.
2. A good readme file should include the details if the project, the languages use in developing the project and highlights the errors in the code.
3. It helps other members of the team to know where to update and make contribution.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

Ans:

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Ans:
Pull request is just a way of transfer your code to your IDE terminal to be able to work locally and push back after working.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Ans:
Forking occur when you want to work on other people project, is a way of copying the project directly to your IDE and clone it afterwards.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
Ans:


## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
